Hi! I'm Pat. I'm a Web Developer and Software Engineer based in San Francisco. Right now, I'm doing a lot of LookML and TypeScript React. I'm learning AWS, and this website is part of that! It's a simple architecure using S3 as a static website host. I plan to implement CloudFront caching next, and continue to explore the use of different AWS products as it becomes necessary.
